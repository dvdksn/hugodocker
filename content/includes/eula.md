Weâ€™ve updated the
[Docker Subscription Service Agreement](https://www.docker.com/legal/docker-subscription-service-agreement).
for all versions before 4.0.0 of Docker Desktop. Docker Desktop is free for
small businesses (fewer than 250 employees AND less than $10 million in annual
revenue), personal use, education, and non-commercial open source projects.
Otherwise, it requires a paid subscription for professional use. Paid
subscriptions are also required for government entities. [Read the FAQ]
