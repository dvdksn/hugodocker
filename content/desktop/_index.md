Docker Desktop is an easy-to-install application for your Mac, Linux, or Windows
environment that enables you to build and share containerized applications and
microservices.

It provides a simple interface that enables you to manage your containers,
applications, and images directly from your machine without having to use the
CLI to perform core actions.

Docker Desktop works with your choice of development tools and languages and
gives you access to a vast library of certified images and templates in
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). This enables development teams to extend
their environment to rapidly auto-build, continuously integrate, and collaborate
using a secure repository.
